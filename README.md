Network Admin assignments done for IT 360 and 460
While all of the labs for the IT 360 class were online, we did have an interesting project where we got to learn about how to
create network diagrams and document findings based on a wifi analyzer

IT 460 for Network Administration starts in the Spring 2019 semester and hopefully more of our hands-on labs will be done in an environment that I can save the labs and push them onto github.
